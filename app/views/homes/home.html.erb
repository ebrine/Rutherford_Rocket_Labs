      <h3>How to use this site</h3>

      </p>
      <p>
        Each time you use the web portal, you must sign in with your employee number and password. Depending on
        your system configuration, the process for setting up and obtaining them differs. Your department supervisor will assign a randomized numerical value and password
        to sign in, follow the specific directions provided by your system installer and in any emails
        you receive associated with this process.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you finish using the web portal, it is important that you explicitly sign out. If you navigate to a
        different web site without signing out of the web portal, your web portal session remains in effect for
        several minutes. If someone else uses your computer, they might be able to access your system without
        you knowing.
